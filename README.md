# Google Maps UI Clone

This is a project aiming at practicing and gettting to know the Dart Programming Language and more particularly for the Flutter SDK.

Its goal was to create an UI Clone of a redesign challenge of [Google Maps](https://www.google.fr/maps) on [Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/) and is inspired by this [Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/6559302-Google-Maps-Redesign-Challenge).
